#A front-end Netflix Clone web application that mimics the look and feel of the real Netflix platform. This project was created for learning and showcasing skills in web development, API integration, and responsive UI design.
The goal of this project is to:

Recreate a popular streaming platform interface to enhance frontend development skills.
Understand how to fetch and dynamically display data from a third-party API.
Practice responsive web design to ensure the app works smoothly across various screen sizes.
Demonstrate how real-world UI/UX patterns are implemented in code.

How It Works:
Homepage UI:
Displays a featured banner with movie/series posters.
Multiple rows (e.g., Trending, Top Rated, Action, Comedy) show categorized movies fetched from the TMDB API.
Clicking on thumbnails can trigger preview animations or more info popups (optional).

TMDB API Integration:
The app uses The Movie Database (TMDB) API to fetch live data like titles, posters, descriptions, and categories.
Axios (or Fetch API) is used to make HTTP requests to TMDB's RESTful endpoints.

Responsive Design:
The layout adjusts automatically for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices using CSS media queries or responsive frameworks.
Search Functionality (if added):
Users can search for any movie or TV show.
Search results are dynamically fetched and rendered in real time.
